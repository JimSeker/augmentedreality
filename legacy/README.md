augmented reality Examples for android. Legacy.
================
    
`ARmarkersDemo` is a demo of drawing 3D objects on the screen when markers are found in the real world.  The markers are in markers/ directory of the project.   There project is very out of date and no longer works or compiles.    It comes from Pro Android AugmentedReality book, https://github.com/RaghavSood/ProAndroidAugmentedReality  I'm going see about updating the example to use current APIs.  But I've got to have time. hoping the author will update their examples.
