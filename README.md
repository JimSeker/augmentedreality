augmented reality Examples for android.
================

eclipse/ has the examples that eclipse can load (no longer updated).  Otherwise, in andriod studio.

<b>basicARDemo</b> a "simple" example that turns on the camera and displays sensor info like gps over the image.  It was always intended to be a simple demo.
     
<b>ARmarkersDemo</b> is a demo of drawing 3D objects on the screen when markers are found in the real world.  The markers are in markers/ directory of the project.   There project is very out of date and has problems, but works.  It comes from Pro Android AugmentedReality book, https://github.com/RaghavSood/ProAndroidAugmentedReality  I'm going see about updating the example to use current APIs.

<b>ARCoreSimpleDemo</b> is a "simple" example using google's ARCore modules.  see https://developers.google.com/ar/  and much of the example is taken from googles hello_ar_java example in https://github.com/google-ar/ 

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course. All examples are for Android.
